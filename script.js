// I want an array that contains a collection of object literals of the book class
// To do the above I need a book constructor that takes in author, title, number of pages, read status, and any other info
// I need a function that creates a new book object using Object.create and adds it to the array
// I need a render function that iterates through the array of books and renders them on the page with their own card/information panel
// I need to program a change read status button that changes the read status with a click
// I need to learn and figure out the fundamentals of firebase to make it possible to store the information.
// I need to clean it all up and make it look visually appealing
